Good patching practice</h1><p>Most people get involved in open-source software by writing patches
for other peoples' software before releasing projects of their own.
Suppose you've written a set of source-code changes for someone else's
baseline code. Now put yourself in that person's shoes. How is he
to judge whether to include the patch?</p><p>The truth is that it is very difficult to judge the quality of code.
So developers tend to evaluate patches by the quality of the submission.
They look for clues in the submitter's style and communications behavior
instead — indications that the person has been in their shoes and
understands what it's like to have to evaluate and merge an incoming patch.
</p><p>This is actually a pretty reliable proxy for code quality.  In many
years of dealing with patches from many hundreds of strangers, I have only
seldom seen a patch that was thoughtfully presented and respectful of my
time but technically bogus.  On the other hand, experience teaches me that
patches which look careless or are packaged in a lazy and inconsiderate way
are very likely to actually <em>be</em> bogus.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to get your patch accepted:</p><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN107"></a>2.1. Do send patches, don't send whole archives or files</h2><p>If your change includes a new file that doesn't exist in the code,
then of course you have to send the whole file.  But if you're modifying
an already-existing file, don't send the whole file.  Send a diff instead;
specifically, send the output of the 
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span>
command run to compare the baseline distributed version against your
modified version.</p><p>The diff command and its dual, 
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">patch</span>(1)</span>
(which automatically applies a diff to a baseline file)
are the most basic tools of open-source development.  Diffs are better
than whole files because the developer you're sending a patch to may
have changed the baseline version since you got your copy.  By sending
him a diff you save him the effort of separating your changes from his;
you show respect for his time.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN117"></a>2.2. Send patches against the current version of the code.</h2><p>It is both counterproductive and rude to send a maintainer
patches against the code as it existed several releases ago, and expect
him to do all the work of determining which changes duplicate things he
have since done, versus which things are actually novel in your patch.</p><p>As a patch submitter, it is <em>your</em> responsibility
to track the state of the source and send the maintainer a minimal patch
that expresses what you want done to the main-line codebase. That means
sending a patch against the current version.</p><p>Nowadays effectively all open-source projects make their source code
available through public anonymous access to the project's version-control
repositrity. The most effective way to ensure that you're patching what's
current is to check the head version of the code out of the project's
repository. All version-control systems have a command that lets you
make a diff between your working copy and head; use that.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN123"></a>2.3. Don't include patches for generated files.</h2><p>Before you send your patch, walk through it and delete any
patch bands for files in it that are going to be automatically regenerated
once he applies the patch and remakes.  The classic examples of this
error are C files generated by <span class="application">Bison</span> 
or <span class="application">Flex</span>.</p><p>These days the most common mistake of this kind is sending a diff
with a huge band that is nothing but changebars between your
<b class="command">configure</b> script and his.  This file is generated by
<b class="command">autoconf</b>.</p><p>This is inconsiderate.  It means your recipient is put to the trouble
of separating the real content of the patch from a lot of bulky noise.
It's a minor error, not as important as some of the things we'll get
to further on — but it will count against you.</p><p>You will probably avoid this automatically if you have checked out
the code from the project repo and use the version-control system's diff
command to generate your patch.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN133"></a>2.4. Don't send patch bands that just tweak version-control $-symbols.</h2><p>Some people put special tokens in their source files that are
expanded by the version-control system when the file is checked in: the
<span class="markup">$Id$</span> construct used by RCS, CVS, and
Subversion, for example.</p><p>If you're using a local version-control system yourself, your changes
may alter these tokens.  This isn't really harmful, because when your
recipient checks his code back in after applying your patch they'll get
re-expanded based on <em>his</em> version-control status.  But
those extra patch bands are noise.  They're distracting.  It's more
considerate not to send them.</p><p>This is another minor error.  You'll be forgiven for it if you
get the big things right.  But you want to avoid it anyway.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN140"></a>2.5. Do use -c or -u format, don't use the default (-e) format</h2><p>The default (-e) format of
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span>
is very brittle.  It doesn't include any context, so the patch tool
can't cope if any lines have been inserted or deleted in the baseline 
code since you took the copy you modified.</p><p>Getting an -e diff is annoying, and suggests that the sender is
either an extreme newbie, careless, or clueless.  Most such patches
get tossed out without a second thought.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN147"></a>2.6. Do include documentation with your patch</h2><p>This is very important.  If your patch makes a user-visible addition
or change to the software's features, <em>include changes to the
appropriate man pages and other documentation files in your patch</em>.
Do <em>not</em> assume that the recipient will be happy to
document your code for you, or else to have undocumented features lurking
in the code.</p><p>Documenting your changes well demonstrates some good things.  First,
it's considerate to the person you are trying to persuade.  Second, it
shows that you understand the ramifications of your change well enough
to explain it to somebody who can't see the code.  Third, it demonstrates
that you care about the people who will ultimately use the software.</p><p>Good documentation is usually the most visible sign of what separates
a solid contribution from a quick and dirty hack.  If you take the time
and care necessary to produce it, you'll find you're already 85% of the
way to having your patch accepted with most developers.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN154"></a>2.7. Do include an explanation with your patch</h2><p>Your patch should include cover notes explaining why you think the
patch is necessary or useful.  This is explanation directed not to the
users of the software but to the maintainer to whom you are sending the
patch.</p><p>The note can be short — in fact, some of the most effective
cover notes I've ever seen just said "See the documentation updates in this
patch".  But it should show the right attitude.</p><p>The right attitude is helpful, respectful of the maintainer's time,
quietly confident but unassuming.  It's good to display understanding of
the code you're patching.  It's good to show that you can identify with the
maintainer's problems. It's also good to be up front about any risks you
perceive in applying the patch.  Here are some examples of the sorts of
explanatory comments that I like to see in cover notes:</p><p><span class="QUOTE">"
I've seen two problems with this code, X and Y.  I fixed problem X, but I
didn't try addressing problem Y because I don't think I understand
the part of the code that I believe is involved.
"</span></p><p><span class="QUOTE">"
Fixed a core dump that can happen when one of the foo inputs is too long.
While I was at it, I went looking for similar overflows elsewhere.  I
found a possible one in blarg.c, near line 666.  Are you sure the sender
can't generate more than 80 characters per transmission?
"</span></p><p><span class="QUOTE">"
Have you considered using the Foonly algorithm for this problem?  There
is a good implementation at &lt;http://www.somesite.com/~jsmith/foonly.html&gt;.
"</span></p><p><span class="QUOTE">"
This patch solves the immediate problem, but I realize it complicates the
memory allocation in an unpleasant way.  Works for me, but you should 
probably test it under heavy load before shipping. 
"</span></p><p><span class="QUOTE">"
This may be featurititis, but I'm sending it anyway.  Maybe you'll know a
cleaner way to implement the feature.
"</span></p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN169"></a>2.8. Do include useful comments in your code</h2><p>Usually as a maintainer, I will want to have strong confidence that I
understand your changes before merging them in.  This isn't an invariable
rule; if you have a track record of good work, with me I may just run a
casual eyeball over the changes before checking them in semi-automatically.
But everything you can do to help me understand your code and decrease my
uncertainty increases your chances that I will accept your patch.</p><p>Good comments in your code help me understand it.  Bad comments 
don't.</p><p>Here's an example of a bad comment:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre class="programlisting">/* norman newbie fixed this 13 Aug 2009 */
</pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This conveys no information.  It's nothing but a muddy territorial 
bootprint you're planting in the middle of my code.  If I take your patch
(which you've made less likely) I'll almost certainly strip out this
comment.  If you want a credit, include a patch band for the project 
<tt class="filename">NEWS</tt> or <tt class="filename">HISTORY</tt> file.  I'll
probably take that.</p><p>Here's an example of a good comment:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre class="programlisting">/*
 * This conditional needs to be guarded so that crunch_data()
 * never gets passed a NULL pointer.  &lt;norman_newbie@foosite.com&gt;
 */
</pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This comment shows that you understand not only my code but the
kind of information that I need to have confidence in your changes.
This kind of comment <em>gives</em> me confidence in your
changes.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN182"></a>2.9. Just one bugfix or new feature per patch.</h2><p>Don't gather various bugfixes, new features or other stuff and
send them as one single diff file. Instead, build a single diff for every
bugfix or feature. Every single diff should be generated using the current
version of the code and should not depend on any other patch you or someone
else sent before.</p><p>This helps the maintainer to read and understand your code, and he can
decide whether he wants to accept or abadon this single bugfix or feature.
For example, if you add a feature garanting full root access for everyone
because it's useful in your special setting, the maintainer will probably not
accept this part of your patch. When you send a single diff file confounding
this root access feature along with some bugfixes and other useful things, you
have a good chance the maintainer will ignore your complete patch.</p><p>With each bugfixes and new feature as a single diff file, the
maintainer could e.g. include your bugfixes in a few minutes and take later
a closer look to your new features or security issues.</p><p>Patches depending on other patches raise similar problems.  If the
maintainer rejects your basic patch, he won't be able to apply the
others. If you can't avoid such dependencies, offer to the maintainer that
you will bundle a patch with the sections or features he wants to
add.</p></div></div><div class="NAVFOOTER"><hr align="LEFT" width="100%"><table summary="Footer navigation table" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="33%" align="left" valign="top"><a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/introduction.html" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td><td width="34%" align="center" valign="top"><a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/index.html" accesskey="H">Home</a></td><td width="33%" align="right" valign="top"><a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/naming.html" accesskey="N">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="33%" align="left" valign="top">Introduction</td><td width="34%" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td width="33%" align="right" valign="top">Good project- and archive- naming practice</td></tr></tbody></table></div></body></html>
