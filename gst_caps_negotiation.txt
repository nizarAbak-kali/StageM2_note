Caps negotiation basics:
	-> A downstream element suggest a format on its sinkpad and places the suggestion in the result of the CAPS query performed on the sinkpad
	-> An upstream element decides on a format. It sends the selected media format downstream on its source pad with a CAPS event. Downstream elements reconfigure 
	themselves to handle the media type in the CAPS event on the sinkpad.
	-> A downstream element can inform upstream that it would like to suggest a new format by sending a RECONFIGURE event upstream. The RECONFIGURE event simply instructs 
	an upstream element to restart the negotiation phase. Because the element that sent out the RECONFIGURE event is now suggesting another format, the format in the pipeline might change.	
Fixed negociation :
	- src pad can only produce a fixed format 
	- no downstream element can ask for diff format 
	- all demuxer work with them
	- some src that produce a fixed format
	- gst_pad_use_fixed_caps(pad)-> source pad 
	exemple:
	pad = gst_pad_new_from_static_template();
	gst_pad_use_fixed_caps(pad);
	
	//the fixed caps can then be set on the pad by calling gst_pad_set_caps()
	caps = gst_caps_new_simple(
		"audio/x-raw",
		"format",G_TYPE_STRING, GST_AUDIO_NE(F32),
		"rate", G_TYPE_INT, <samplerate>
		channels", G_TYPE_INT, <num-channels>, NULL);

	if (!gst_pad_set_caps (pad, caps)) {
		GST_ELEMENT_ERROR (element, CORE, NEGOTIATION, (NULL),("Some debug information here"));
		return GST_FLOW_ERROR;	          
	}
